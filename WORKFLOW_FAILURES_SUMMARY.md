# GitHub Actions Workflow Failures Summary

This document summarizes the reasons why various GitHub Actions workflows are failing in the NEAR-Swift-Client repository.

## Overview

All four main workflows are currently failing:
1. **Generate and Update Client** (generate.yml) - Last run: #51
2. **Release** (release.yml) - Last run: #4  
3. **Test Independent Packages** (test-packages.yml) - Last run: #4
4. **Tests** (test.yml) - Last run: #5

---

## 1. Tests Workflow (test.yml)

### Status: ❌ FAILING

### Jobs Failing:
- **test-macos**: Swift compiler crash
- **test-linux**: Platform compatibility issues
- **lint**: SwiftLint violations

### Root Causes:

#### A. macOS Build Failure
**Symptom**: Swift compiler internal assertion failure  
**Error**: `ProtocolConformance.cpp::setWitness` crash during type-checking

**Details**:
- Swift frontend crashes with internal compiler error
- System modules fail to import (Darwin, DarwinFoundation, _math, _stddef)
- Multiple "unknown type name" errors in SDK headers
- Indicates Swift toolchain/SDK mismatch or corruption

**Impact**: Complete build failure on macOS

#### B. Linux Build Failure  
**Symptom**: Foundation networking types unavailable  
**Error**: `URLSession`, `URLRequest` not found

**Details**:
- Missing `FoundationNetworking` module import
- Errors originate in `JSONRPCWrapper.swift` and generated code
- Platform compatibility issues between Darwin and Linux Foundation
- Build aborts with emit-module failure

**Impact**: Complete build failure on Linux

#### C. Lint Failure
**Symptom**: 135 SwiftLint violations (20 serious)  
**Error**: Exit code 2 from swiftlint

**Details**:
- **Error-level violations**:
  - `force_try`: Using try! instead of proper error handling
  - `force_cast`: Using as! instead of safe casting
  - `identifier_name`: Non-compliant naming conventions
- Violations across 26 files
- Affects both test and source files

**Impact**: Code quality check fails

---

## 2. Test Independent Packages Workflow (test-packages.yml)

### Status: ❌ FAILING

### Jobs Failing:
- **test-types-package**: NEARJSONRPCTypes build failure
- **test-client-package**: NEARJSONRPCClient build failure  
- **test-integration**: Root workspace build failure
- **verify-independence**: Package independence verification failure

### Root Causes:

#### A. Xcode Version Mismatch
**Symptom**: Xcode 15.4 not available on runner  
**Error**: Cannot find specified Xcode version

**Details**:
- Workflow specifies Xcode 15.4
- macOS-14 runner may not have this version installed
- Causes job to fail before build even starts

**Impact**: Cannot run tests on specified Xcode version

#### B. Same Swift Compiler Issues
**Details**:
- Inherits the macOS Swift compiler crash issue from Tests workflow
- Same Foundation networking compatibility issues on independent package builds
- Build failures cascade to integration tests

**Impact**: All package-level tests fail

---

## 3. Generate and Update Client Workflow (generate.yml)

### Status: ❌ FAILING

### Jobs Failing:
- **generate**: Client generation and testing

### Root Causes:

#### A. Swift Code Generation Failures
**Symptom**: Generated code fails to compile  
**Details**:
- `swift run generate` produces code with issues
- Generated Swift client from OpenAPI spec has compilation errors
- Likely related to the same Swift compiler issues

#### B. Test Failures in Generated Code
**Symptom**: Tests fail after code generation  
**Details**:
- When spec changes are detected, generated code is tested
- Tests in NEARJSONRPCTypes fail to compile/run
- Inherits Swift compiler and platform issues

#### C. Missing File: openapi-cached.json
**Details**:
- Workflow checks for `openapi-cached.json` to detect spec changes
- File may not exist, causing workflow logic issues

**Impact**: Unable to generate and validate updated client code

---

## 4. Release Workflow (release.yml)

### Status: ❌ FAILING

### Jobs Failing:
- **pre-release-validation**: Comprehensive validation before release

### Root Causes:

#### A. Pre-Release Validation Failures
**Multiple sub-failures**:

1. **Build Failure**
   - `swift build` fails due to Swift compiler issues
   - Same root cause as Tests workflow

2. **Test Failure**  
   - `swift test --enable-code-coverage` fails
   - Cannot run tests due to build failures

3. **Coverage Generation Failure**
   - Cannot generate coverage report without successful test run
   - `xcrun llvm-cov` fails due to missing test binaries

4. **Coverage Threshold Check Failure**
   - Even if coverage could be generated, likely below 80% threshold
   - Code quality gates prevent release

5. **SwiftLint Strict Mode Failure**
   - `swiftlint --strict` exits with errors
   - Same 135 violations as Tests workflow
   - Strict mode treats warnings as errors

6. **Documentation Check Failure**
   - Missing RELEASING.md file (warning, not blocker)

#### B. Conventional Commits Check
**Details**:
- Release workflow checks for conventional commit format
- May skip release if commit doesn't follow format
- Not currently blocking but affects release automation

**Impact**: Cannot create releases due to validation failures

## Common Root Causes Across All Workflows

### 1. Swift Compiler Environment Issues ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Affects**: All workflows  
**Symptoms**:
- Internal compiler errors on macOS
- System module import failures
- SDK/toolchain mismatch

**Likely Causes**:
- Incompatible Swift version (5.9) with runner environment
- Corrupted Swift Package Manager cache
- Xcode command line tools mismatch

### 2. Platform Compatibility Issues ⚠️ HIGH
**Affects**: Linux builds, cross-platform support  
**Symptoms**:
- Missing FoundationNetworking imports
- URLSession/URLRequest unavailable on Linux

**Root Cause**:
- Code uses Darwin-specific Foundation APIs
- Missing explicit import of FoundationNetworking for Linux
- Generated code not platform-aware

### 3. Code Quality Issues ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Affects**: All workflows with lint step  
**Symptoms**:
- 135 SwiftLint violations
- Force unwrapping (try!, as!)
- Naming convention violations

**Root Cause**:
- Generated code doesn't follow SwiftLint rules
- Test code uses forced unwrapping
- Code needs cleanup and refactoring

### 4. Missing Documentation ⚠️ LOW
**Affects**: Release workflow  
**Symptoms**:
- RELEASING.md file not found

**Root Cause**:
- Documentation file was never created or was removed

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Fix Swift Compiler Issues**
   ```yaml
   # Option 1: Update Swift version
   - name: Setup Swift
     uses: swift-actions/setup-swift@v1
     with:
       swift-version: "5.10"  # Try newer version
   
   # Option 2: Clear SPM cache
   - name: Clear SPM cache
     run: |
       rm -rf .build
       rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm
   ```

2. **Fix Linux Platform Compatibility**
   ```swift
   // Add to all files using URLSession/URLRequest
   #if canImport(FoundationNetworking)
   import FoundationNetworking
   #endif
   ```

3. **Fix SwiftLint Violations**
   ```bash
   # Auto-fix what can be fixed
   swiftlint --fix
   
   # Review and manually fix remaining issues:
   # - Replace try! with proper error handling
   # - Replace as! with safe casting (as?)
   # - Fix identifier naming
   ```

### Short-term Actions (High Priority)

4. **Update Xcode Version Requirement**
   ```yaml
   # test-packages.yml
   strategy:
     matrix:
       xcode: ['15.2']  # Use stable version available on runners
   ```

5. **Add RELEASING.md Documentation**
   ```bash
   # Create release documentation
   echo "# Release Process" > RELEASING.md
   ```

6. **Update OpenAPI Generation**
   - Review generated code for platform compatibility
   - Add SwiftLint exceptions for generated files
   - Ensure generated code imports FoundationNetworking

### Long-term Actions (Medium Priority)

7. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Replace force unwrapping with proper error handling
   - Use guard statements and optional chaining
   - Add proper error types

8. **Code Quality**
   - Address all SwiftLint violations
   - Add SwiftFormat for consistent formatting
   - Update code style guide

9. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add integration tests
   - Improve test coverage above 80%
   - Add platform-specific test suites

10. **CI/CD Improvements**
    - Add retry logic for transient failures
    - Improve caching strategy
    - Add dependency vulnerability scanning
